"""
Synthetic Market Environment with Controllable Regime-Switching.

This environment enables rigorous evaluation of agent specialization by:
1. Providing known ground truth regime labels
2. Allowing statistical significance through unlimited data
3. Enabling controlled parameter sweeps
4. Ensuring perfect reproducibility

Theoretical Reference:
- Hamilton, J.D. (1989). "A New Approach to the Economic Analysis of
  Nonstationary Time Series." Econometrica, 57(2), 357-384.

The regime-switching is modeled as a Hidden Markov Model where:
- Hidden states = market regimes (trend, mean_revert, volatile, sideways)
- Observations = price returns
- Transition matrix controls regime persistence
