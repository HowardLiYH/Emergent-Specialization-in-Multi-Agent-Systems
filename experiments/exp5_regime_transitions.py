Experiment 5: Regime Transition Behavior

Research Question: How do specialized agents behave during regime transitions?

Hypothesis H5: During regime transitions:
  (a) The "winning" agent changes to the new regime's specialist
  (b) Transition speed depends on transfer frequency
  (c) Population maintains diversity even during transitions

Protocol:
1. Generate data with clear regime transitions (longer regimes)
2. Track which agent wins before/during/after transition
3. Measure transition delay (bars until new specialist dominates)
4. Repeat 50 times

Statistical Analysis:
- Chi-square test for agent switching
- Time-series analysis of winner identity

Expected Results:
- Clear agent switching at regime changes
- Transition delay of 5-10 bars
- Specialists maintain performance in their regimes
